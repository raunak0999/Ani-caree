# Replit.md - Pet Care Platform

## Overview

This is a comprehensive pet care platform built with a modern full-stack architecture. The application provides AI-powered personalized recommendations for pet care, including nutrition, grooming, and health advice, along with an e-commerce component for pet products and training resources.

## System Architecture

The application follows a monorepo structure with clearly separated frontend and backend concerns:

- **Frontend**: React TypeScript SPA with Vite build system
- **Backend**: Express.js REST API server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o for personalized recommendations and chat

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite with hot module replacement
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: 
  - TanStack Query for server state
  - Zustand for cart management
  - React Hook Form for form state
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom color variables

### Backend Architecture
- **Server**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database Access**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with proper error handling
- **External Services**: OpenAI API for AI-powered features

### Data Layer
The application uses a well-structured PostgreSQL schema with the following main entities:

1. **Pet Profiles**: Core pet information (name, age, breed, size)
2. **Products**: E-commerce catalog with categorization and ratings
3. **Care Recommendations**: AI-generated personalized care advice
4. **Training Programs**: Structured training content
5. **Chat Messages**: Conversational AI chat history

### Authentication & Authorization
Currently uses session-based approach with express sessions, though no authentication implementation is visible in the current codebase.

## Data Flow

1. **Pet Profile Creation**: Users create pet profiles which trigger AI recommendation generation
2. **AI Recommendations**: OpenAI generates personalized care advice based on pet characteristics
3. **Product Catalog**: Users browse and add products to cart with persistent storage
4. **AI Chat**: Real-time conversation with AI assistant for pet care questions
5. **Training Content**: Static training programs filtered by pet characteristics
